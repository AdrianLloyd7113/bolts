# Bolts Engine #
*Author: Adrian Lloyd, 2025*

*Bolts* is a very simple game engine, built in C++, which I have developed to power small 3D, first-person games. 
*Bolts* is built using OpenGL, GLFW, GLM, and KHR.  
The core objective of *Bolts* was to develop a lightweight, custom-designed engine for my own games, to reduce my 
dependence on existing third-party options like Unity (specifically for more simple projects).  
  
*Bolts* currently handles basic geometric rendering, input and physics for 3D worlds. This project serves as an engine 
template, to be used for building games using the engine's functions.
